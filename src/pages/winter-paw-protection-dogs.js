            <h1>Winter Paw-tection for Dogs</h1>
            <p>
              In my snowy Northeastern town, there is a blizzard blowing through 
              that’s estimated to last about 2 days. Talk about an opportune time
              to discuss paw protection!

                Last year, I made my first contribution to PetPlace with <a href="https://www.petplace.com/article/dogs/pet-care/does-puppy-need-snow-boots/" target="_blank">Does My Puppy
                Need Snow Boots?</a>. I learned so much about paw care while writing and researching, specifically that my 
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLIlBzAAoBw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank">Westie</a> pup needed boots due to his 
                size and height. 
              </p>
              <p>
                At first glance, most dog boots look alike, so I’ve decided to compile a 
                list of popular boots in a variety of looks and sizes to meet your doggo’s 
                needs. Pick a pair to keep your pup protected this winter, and be sure to 
                scroll down for an exclusive discount code just for PetPlace readers!
              </p>
              <h4>Important Tip:</h4>
              <p>
                Be sure to measure your pup’s paws carefully, following product instruction. 
                Most boot brands listed below offer measurement charts for an accurate fit. 
                Try them on at home before taking your fur buddy out in the snow and be patient 
                as your pupster gets used to walking in their new boots. P.S.: watching your 
                fido trying to master the bootie-walk is priceless and should lift your spirits 
                during the grey winter season.

            <h3>Balms</h3>

                Made of 100% pure natural wax, beeswax, and vitamin E, this balm doesn't just have a <a href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101l9vcZ/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chewy.com%2Fmushers-secret-paw-protection-natural%2Fdp%2F128336" target="_blank">cult 
                following</a> among pet owners, it also has hordes of horse-loving devotees. The super-moisturizing 
                formula soothes cracked paw pads and hooves, creating a breathable, yet dense, barrier. This 
                means hot concrete, steamy sand beaches, and icy terrain are no match for its protective powers. 
                A little dab goes a long way, so keep this balm handy and use on parched snouts too.
