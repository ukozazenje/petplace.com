                Ready to bring a new puppy into your life? There is so much
                excitement around welcoming a new pup into your home that
                critical aspects of pet parenthood might get overlooked. This is
                especially true when it comes to the cost of care for your new

                Read on for a closer look at the average costs of caring for a

                    <strong>DAPP Vaccine (1 of 3):</strong> At six to eight
                    weeks of age, your puppy will get their first dose of the
                    DAPP vaccine. Considered a core vaccination, this shot
                    protects your pup against four different common viruses:
                    Canine Distemper Virus, Canine Adenovirus, Canine
                    Parainfluenza, and Canine Parvovirus. This initial dose is a
                    primer intended to boost your dog’s immune system in
                    anticipation of the full vaccine. It usually costs between{" "}
                    <strong>$20 and $30</strong> for each dose. The cost of this
                    first dose may be included in your adoption or purchase fee.

                Depending on the breed, purchasing a purebred dog from a breeder
                could cost anywhere between{" "}

                    Some shelters and adoption centers may offer pets for free,
                    but prospective pet parents should expect to pay{" "}
                    <strong>as much as $500</strong>, since adoption fees often
                    help cover costs associated with vaccination, microchipping,

                    Whichever option you choose, you probably won’t bring home
                    your new dog until they’ve reached eight weeks of age. In
                    some cases, breeders and shelters may wait until the pup has
                    reached 12 weeks. That means you’ll miss out on a few key
                    milestones (like their first baby teeth) and some early
                    expenses like the ones listed in the previous section.

                <strong>Initial Veterinary Visit:</strong> Within the first week
                of bringing your puppy home, you should make your first trip to
                the vet. New dog owners could pay around{" "}
                <strong>$75 to $100</strong> for this introductory visit. The
                vet will conduct a general examination to identify signs of
                congenital disorders or infections. They’ll also review your
                puppy’s vaccination history (expect to be charged if they
                haven’t had that first DAPP dose at this visit) and assess their
                stool to check for intestinal parasites. Don’t forget to bring
                along any medical records you have, a stool sample (if
                applicable), and any burning questions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Heartworm Prevention:</strong> The American Heartworm
                Society encourages pet owners to begin treating their dogs with
                preventive medicine against heartworm when they’re around eight
                weeks of age. Treatment types vary, and your veterinarian may
                suggest oral, topical, or injectible preventive treatments.
                Typically, they recommend that pets undergo these treatments
                throughout the entire year. Depending on your dog’s weight,
                preventing heartworm will cost between{" "}
                <strong>$30 and $80</strong> each year. If you’re on the fence
                about whether or not this is a necessary expense, keep this in
                mind: a single bite from an infected mosquito can cause
                heartworm, and preventing them is typically much less expensive
                than getting rid of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Bordetella Vaccine:</strong> The vaccine against
                Bordetella (also known as kennel cough) is optional, but some
                pet care establishments like dog daycares and overnight boarding
                facilities require pets to be vaccinated. It costs between{" "}
                <strong>$20 and $45</strong> on average. If you choose to
                vaccinate your dog, it can be administered concurrently with
                their first dose of heartworm prevention medicine and the DAPP
                vaccine.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Canine Coronavirus Vaccine:</strong> Not to be confused
                with the vaccine for COVID-19, this vaccine protects pooches
                against a different type of respiratory illness. Sometimes, this
                vaccine is included with the DAPP vaccination, but as a
                stand-alone vaccination, it costs between{" "}
                <strong>$15 and $20</strong>.

                    <strong>Food and Treats:</strong> Your puppy needs
                    specially-formulated food to thrive and you’ll most likely
                    want treats to both show affection and aid in training.
                    Depending on your dog’s size and energy level, you’ll likely
                    pay between <strong>$20 and $60</strong> on food each month.

                <strong>Toys:</strong> Toys aren’t just about fun and games.
                They're useful for teaching basic commands, helping keep pets
                physically and mentally fit, and building a strong bond. As your
                puppy’s first set of 28 teeth begin to fall out and their new
                set of 42 adult teeth grow in, they’ll need plenty of toys to
                soothe their sore gums. You’ll want to keep them comfortable
                while keeping them away from your shoes, rugs, and furniture.

                reimbursement for both emergency and routine expenses. Plans
                start as low as $15 per month for basic accident and illness
                coverage. Providers offer more benefits for an additional fee
                and give pet owners the option to customize plans to meet their
                pet’s needs.

              <p className="p-subtitle">Medical Needs</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Routine Checkup:</strong> Your vet will take another
                look at your puppy to ensure they’re growing into a healthy
                young dog. These routine visits will happen twice-a-year and
                typically cost between <strong>$45 and $55</strong> for a
                wellness check. This will be a recurring expense throughout your
                dog’s life.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>DAPP Vaccine (2 of 3):</strong> About three weeks after
                their first DAPP shot, it’s time for your puppy to receive dose
                #2, which is another <strong>$20 to $30</strong> expense.

                    <strong>Rabies Vaccine:</strong> Your dog will need a rabies
                    vaccine to protect them from this deadly and widespread
                    virus. The initial dose costs around{" "}
                    <strong>$15 to $20</strong> and your dog will get it
                    somewhere between 12 and 16 weeks of age. Remember that your
                    dog will need additional rabies boosters to keep up their
                    immunity in the coming years.

                    <strong>Flea and Tick Prevention:</strong> After they’ve
                    reached eight weeks of age, it’s safe for puppies to be
                    treated with pest-prevention medications. If you live in a
                    high-risk area, these treatments may be a year-round
                    necessity. On average, a three-month supply of medication
                    costs <strong>around $50.</strong>

                <strong>Food and Treats:</strong> Unless you bought in bulk or

                <strong>DAPP Vaccine (3 of 3):</strong> About three weeks after

                <strong>Leptospirosis Vaccination:</strong> Your vet may
                recommend vaccinating your puppy against Leptospirosis around
                this age. This disease of the kidneys and liver is mostly spread
                by infected rodents and is treatable with antibiotics. As with
                other canine illnesses, prevention is often less expensive than
                treatment. The vaccine costs between{" "}

                time hiking or outdoors with your pet, it may be a wise
                decision. However, keep in mind that indoor dogs are still
