                That’s not to mention all the work that goes into pet-proofing a
                house. While you’re putting up the holiday decorations, look
                around for potential pet safety hazards, because they are more
                abundant than you might expect. Make it fun and invite the whole
                family to help you take the following steps:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Hide or cover electrical cords to prevent chewing</li>
                <li>
                  Remove choking hazards from the floor and other pet-level
                  surfaces
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ensure potentially poisonous foods and products are safely
                  stored
                </li>
                <li>
                  Get in the habit of covering trash cans and closing all
                  appliance doors
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Watch out for holiday decorations too! Puppies and kittens are
                naturally curious. They’ll bat, jump, and paw at just about
                anything, so make sure to hang those stockings with extra care.

              <h3>Don’t Forget About Pet Insurance!</h3>
              <p>
                When you think of pet essentials, pet insurance often gets
                overlooked. However, like car or health insurance, pet insurance
                provides protection against future costs. It’s also similar to
                human health insurance in the sense that some policies cover
                routine wellness and preventative services.
              </p>
              <p>
                Depending on the type of coverage you choose, pet insurance can
                offer financial assistance for some or all of the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Accidents and Injuries:</strong> Nearly all pet
                  insurance policies offer coverage for medical mishaps like
                  bone and muscle injuries or insect bites. PetPartners plans

                  like acupuncture and massage therapy have grown more popular,
                  some pet insurance providers have begun reimbursing

                <li>
                  <strong>Chronic Conditions</strong>: This is where pet
                  insurance can become a major money-saver. Like humans, pets
                  become more likely to develop chronic conditions as they age.
                  Affecting the joints and organs, these can lead to everyday
                  symptoms and disrupt their quality of life. A pet insurance
                  plan with chronic condition coverage will help you maintain
                  their standard of living without breaking the bank.{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Illnesses</strong>: Pet insurance may provide coverage
                  for temporary conditions in addition to life-threatening
                  diseases like cancer. The treatments and procedures for these
                  illnesses are typically quite costly, and pet insurance can
                  provide you with financial peace of mind so that you can tend
                  to your four-legged friend during their time of need.{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Routine and Preventative Care</strong>: Some pet
                  insurance policies, like PetPartners’ Defender and
                  DefenderPlus Wellness plans, offer coverage for regular
                  expenses like pest prevention treatments, vaccines, and exams.
                  While not big-ticket items, these services and treatments can
                  add up quickly. Wellness Plan policyholders can avoid hundreds
                  or thousands in expenses over the lifetime of their pet.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                An inexpensive pet insurance plan may cover accidents or
                illnesses alone. More comprehensive offerings, on the other
                hand, may include insurance benefits beyond those noted above.
                Your selection of pet insurance plans will vary based on your
                zip code. That will also help to determine how much you’ll pay
                for coverage, along with several other factors.
              </p>
              <h3>Benefits of Pet Insurance</h3>
              <p>
                A dog or cat would probably rather tear into some treats, but
                they’d thank you for purchasing a pet insurance policy if they
                could. Insurance boasts benefits that make it an ideal present
                for pets and pet parents alike:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pet InsuranceSaves Money</strong>: Pet care isn’t
                  cheap. Both routine and emergency expenses add up fast and
                  sometimes force pet parents to make impossible decisions. With
                  pet insurance, you’ll never have to make the choice between
                  your pet’s health and your own financial well-being.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pet Insurance Fits Your Needs</strong>: Nobody likes
                  paying for things they don’t want or need. Fortunately, pet
                  insurance plans don’t saddle policyholders with unexpected or
                  unnecessary expenses. Plans are flexible to your pet’s
                  specific needs, as well as your own budget concerns.{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pet Insurance Provides Peace of Mind</strong>: TAny
                  dog or cat owner will tell you to expect the unexpected.
                  Accidents, injuries, and other pet health emergencies can
                  occur at any moment. Pet insurance can’t eliminate stress, but
                  it can certainly help you keep a cooler head in these
                  instances. As you seek out veterinary care, you’ll be able to
                  act with confidence, secure in the knowledge that your
                  provider has you covered.{" "}

              <div className="columns gift-pet-insurance-columns">

                  <p>
                    Looking for a holiday gift that truly shows that special
                    someone how much you care? Consider purchasing pet insurance
                    for a friend or loved one with a new pet. Simply put, pet
                    insurance is the gift that keeps on giving long after the

                  <p>
                    A pet insurance policy can keep expenses manageable, ease
                    your mind, and even help save a pet’s life. Insurance can’t
                    prevent pet health emergencies or eliminate the need for
                    routine care, but it can dramatically reduce the financial
                    and emotional toll of both. What’s a better gift than that?
