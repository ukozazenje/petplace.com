                    Over more than 15 years, PetPlace has developed a vast
                    audience among pet enthusiasts and industry experts. Our
                    blog reaches nearly 1,000,000 unique visitors each month,
                    our newsletters have more than 400,000 combined subscribers,
                    and we’ve built a sizable following across all major social
                    media platforms.

                    Even veterinary students get tired of sifting through
                    textbooks! PetPlace’s content should be accessible to all
                    readers from the first-time pet owner to the seasoned
                    expert.

                    <br />
                    Take a look around the PetPlace library and you’ll see that
                    our writers have published a lot of content over the years.
                    That doesn’t mean they’ve covered everything. PetPlace is
                    always interested in articles that find novel ways to
                    explore evergreen subjects. Feel free to submit a number of
                    ideas for the editorial team to review.

                    <br />
                    PetPlace is committed to covering a range of topics and
                    perspectives. In general, however, the editorial staff
                    avoids publishing opinion-based pieces related to
                    controversial subjects. For example, PetPlace is more likely
                    to accept an article about the merits of obedience training
                    than one championing shock collars or discouraging routine
                    vaccinations. If you’re interested in exploring a topic that
                    may “ruffle some feathers,” take care to remain as objective
                    as possible in your writing.
