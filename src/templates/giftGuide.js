              <p>
                Puzzled about the breed of your rescue pup? As a responsible pet
                owner, knowing their lineage can help you to better understand
                your dog’s unique appearance, training requirements, behaviors,
                and health/wellness needs. This simple kit from Wisdom Panel
                lets you swab your dog’s cheek, send it off in a postage-paid
                box, and discover your dog’s genetic background in just 2 - 3
                weeks. It’s traced back to the great-grandpawrent level, with
                over 250 breeds detected. All of the tests include a predicted
                weight profile and will check for the multi-drug resistance 1
                (MDR1) genetic mutation that may cause severe adverse reactions
                to commonly prescribed drugs.

            <GiftBox title="Furbo Dog Camera" img={GiftImg16}>
              <p>
                The separation anxiety you’re feeling about returning to a
                semi-normal life after working from home these past few months
                is not in your head—both for you and your beloved dog. Thanks to
                the Furbo Dog Camera, both of you can feel like you’re at home
                even when you’re not. The camera not only lets you see what’s
                going on with your four-legged friend, but also allows you to
                give them a treat from afar. The Furbo Dog Camera has been used
                by over 5,000 vets and professional trainers, has an alert to
                let you know when your dog is barking, and even has a night
                vision setting, which should come in handy during these dark
                winter months.

              <p>
                There are two main reasons why you’d want to increase the
                potency of your dog’s CBD regimen: it can be more
                cost-effective, and it provides your pet with a stronger dose of
                CBD (which can be necessary in certain cases). The Extra
                Strength Wellness Tincture has 1000mg of organic full-spectrum
                hemp oil and could be ideal for your doggo, depending on their
                circumstances.{" "}

              <p>
                While pet insurance might seem like a strange gift to give for
                the holidays, it’s actually one of the best ways to show your
                pet that you love them. In an emergency, good pet insurance will
                cover medical costs so you never have to choose between going
                into debt and saving your pet’s life. The pet experts over at
                PetPartners are exactly that: experts. They have vet technicians
                and animal lovers on their staff who can walk you through
                exactly what type of coverage you might need for your beloved
                pet.
