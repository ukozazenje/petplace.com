            <p>
              Everyone knows that caring for pets is hard work. It can be hectic, stressful, even overwhelming -- sometimes. More often than not, dogs, cats, rabbits, birds, snakes, and other pets are a whole lot of fun. That’s why the PetPlace team doesn’t stop at offering medical advice and how-to pet care guides. We’ve also dedicated an entire “wing” of our site to light-hearted content that’ll put a smile on your face. 
            </p>
            <p>In PetPlace’s Just for Fun section, you can read the latest celebrity pet news, check out furtastic photos from Instagram-famous pups, find recipes for tasty homemade cat treats, take quizzes to test your tropical bird know-how, answer surveys to find the perfect fish, and much, much more.</p>
