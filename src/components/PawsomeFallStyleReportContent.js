          Alas, as if on cue, September brought a dip in temperature and, with a
          distinct chill in the air, I awoke reaching for socks and a fleece
          robe. Brrrr… buh-bye summer! Time to pull out the jeans, sweaters, and
          boots that had been sitting in storage for months.

          As I started swapping out my summer wardrobe for something more

          Your pupper begs for 5 walks a day or is one of the lucky ones that

              My Westie has an ID tag dangling from his collar, which I change
              out to reflect the colors of the changing seasons. Yes, I am that
              pup mom. However, while researching for this article, I stumbled
              upon stylish personalized collars that feature embroidered pet
              names. Guess what else is in my cart?{" "}
