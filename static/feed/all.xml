<p>Occasionally, an animal’s ability to clot blood is diminished. This is called a coagulation disorder or a coagulopathy. Coagulopathies can be life threatening, as they can lead to hemorrhage and bleeding into a major organ, which may cause an animal to rapidly decompensate.<a name="section2"></a></p>
<p>Hemophilia is caused by a lack of certain proteins that allow blood to clot properly. These proteins are referred to as clotting or coagulation factors. These factors are produced in the liver and circulate in the bloodstream. When a blood vessel or tissue is injured, the thirteen factors work together in a specific order to form the coagulation cascade, a complex process designed to slow and eventually stop bleeding. These specific proteins work in conjunction with platelets to help the body make blood clots and stop bleeding.</p>
<h2>Hemophilia A</h2>
<p>Hemophilia A is the most common clotting disorder in both humans and animals. It has been <a href="https://www.merckvetmanual.com/circulatory-system/hemostatic-disorders/coagulation-protein-disorders-in-animals?query=hemophilia#v3258551" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">observed in cats, dogs, horses, and cattle</a>. It is caused by a mutation of the gene that produces Factor VIII, which is an important clotting protein. Once this mutation has occurred, it can then be passed down through generations. Hemophilia is a <a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/animal-health-diagnostic-center/laboratories/comparative-coagulation/clinical-topics/hemophilia-a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sex-linked recessive gene</a>, meaning that it is carried on the X chromosome and will be dormant in the presence of a dominant gene. All males have one X gene, which they inherit from their mothers, and all females have two, one which is inherited from the mother and one from the father. As it is a recessive gene, the existence of just one normal X gene is enough to keep the disorder from manifesting. Since females have two X genes, they can have one normal X gene and one mutated gene, making them carriers. As carriers, they will not show any signs of hemophilia themselves, but can still pass the disorder to their offspring and should not be bred.</p>
<h3>What Are the Symptoms?</h3>
<p>The severity of clinical signs will depend on the <a href="https://eclinpath.com/hemostasis/disorders/inherited-coagulation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">severity of disease</a>. Normal animals show activity of Factor VIII at greater than 60%, whereas carriers show activity at 40 &#8211; 60%. Animals with mild disease show 6 &#8211; 20% activity. Most animals show less than 6% of activity and can be defined as having moderate to severe disease.</p>
<p><a name="section3"></a>Signs of Hemophilia A include bleeding spontaneously into muscles or joints (causing lameness or swelling), bleeding under the skin (hematoma), and hemorrhaging into the chest or abdominal cavity. If the hemorrhage is severe enough, it can be fatal. Hemophilia A is typically not diagnosed until an animal undergoes surgery or experiences trauma. It is usually suspected in young animals who have extreme bleeding after routine procedures, such as vaccines or spay/neuter surgeries. There may also be abnormal bleeding of the gums when growing teeth. Puppies and kittens who have a severe deficiency of Factor VIII may be stillborn or die shortly after birth due to extreme hemorrhaging.</p>
<h2>Hemophilia B</h2>
<p>Hemophilia B is less common than Hemophilia A. Similar to Hemophilia A, Hemophilia B is a mutation in the gene that produces a certain clotting factor. In this case, it is Factor IX, which is also known as the Christmas Factor. <a href="https://eclinpath.com/hemostasis/disorders/inherited-coagulation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">It has been noted in</a> Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherds, mixed-breed dogs, British short-haired cats, and Siamese mix cats. Hemophila B is also a <a href="https://eclinpath.com/hemostasis/disorders/inherited-coagulation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sex-linked gene</a> on the X chromosome. Carriers are female and most are asymptomatic, but they should not be bred to prevent passing the gene to offspring.</p>
<h3>What Are the Symptoms?</h3>
<p><a name="section4"></a>Hemophilia B has many of the same clinical symptoms as A, though it tends to be a milder disease. Animals may spontaneously bleed into the thorax, abdomen, or brain. These bleeding episodes may not be noticed until they become an emergency. Bleeding that is unchecked can cause muscle necrosis, seizures, and/or shock. Often, there is no problem until there is surgery or trauma that causes extreme bleeding.</p>
<h2>Hemophilia C</h2>
<p>Hemophilia C is an extremely rare deficiency of Factor XI. It has been recognized in the Springer Spaniel, Great Pyrenees, Weimaraner, and Kerry Blue Terrier <a href="https://eclinpath.com/hemostasis/disorders/inherited-coagulation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">breeds</a>. Like A and B, this disorder is also linked to a gene. Unlike A and B, it is an autosomal inheritance, meaning it is not connected to a sex chromosome and not passed by any specific gender. It is unknown if it is a dominant or recessive gene.</p>
<h3>What Are the Symptoms?</h3>
<p><a name="section5"></a>In Hemophilia C, bleeding is induced by trauma or surgery. The animal appears to be recovering normally until 24 &#8211; 48 hours post surgery, when hemorrhaging begins. Bleeding can be delayed for up to 4 days. Research in humans shows that there may be a relation between Hemophilia C and the early breakdown of clots, due to the lack of a preventative enzyme. Though clots are initially formed, they are quickly destroyed, explaining the delayed bleeding.</p>
<h2>How Is Hemophilia Diagnosed?</h2>
<p>As hemophilia is a disorder of the coagulation of blood, the main tests performed are blood tests. The activated partial thromboplastin time test (aPTT) screens for coagulation disorders. aPTT measures how long it takes for blood to form a clot. In animals with hemophilia, this time will be increased. Many specialty clinics will have the machine necessary to run this test in hospital.</p>
<p>An activated coagulation time (ACT) may also be run. For this test, blood is placed into a tube, which contains a substance called diatomaceous earth that activates coagulation factors. If the factors are low, it will take longer for the blood in these tubes to clot. <a name="section6"></a>While these tests reveal that there is a clotting disorder, they do not tell us specifically which disorder is present. In order to discover which factor is deficient, the blood must be sent to an outside lab where they can measure the coagulation factor levels.</p>
<p>Testing is not always definitive in animals younger than 6 months old, as they often have a lower level of coagulation factor activity.</p>
<h2>How Is Hemophilia Treated?</h2>
<p>Treatment for all three types of hemophilia involves transfusions of blood products. There are many products that can be used, but fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate are preferred. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is the fluid portion of blood that is frozen within 8 hours. FFP contains all coagulation factors. Cryoprecipitate is prepared from fresh frozen plasma that has been run through a centrifuge to separate and gather the solid parts of the fluid. This is then mixed with a small amount of plasma and frozen or freeze dried. When using freeze-dried cryoprecipitate, it needs to be reconstituted with sterile saline. Cryoprecipitate contains most coagulation factors, but has a large amount of Factor VIII, so it is most useful for hemophilia A.</p>
<p>These blood products are used because, unlike whole blood which contains all elements found in blood, they do not contain red blood cells (RBCs). <a name="section7"></a>RBCs contain antigens, which are substances that are recognized as foreign by the body, leading to an immune response. By transfusing products that do not contain RBCs, a reaction is less likely. Animals may need multiple transfusions of plasma or cryoprecipitate to curb bleeding. They may also need multiple transfusions throughout their lifetimes. Since you are only transfusing the parts of blood that the animal needs, less is necessary than if utilizing whole blood.</p>
<h2>Is Hemophilia Curable?</h2>
<p>There is no cure for hemophilia. It is an inherited disease and part of the animal’s genetic makeup. Animals will exhibit a life-long bleeding tendency, and it is important for owners to be aware and careful in relation to this condition. With proper care, animals with hemophilia can live long and normal lives.</p>

<p>Looking for a sport that both you and <a href="https://www.petplace.com/article/cats/pet-behavior-training/indoor-exercises-games-pets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your dog can enjoy</a>? Check out dog agility.</p>
<p>“Agility” is an obstacle course made up of tunnels, walkways, and jumps. A dog and their handler work together as a team, navigate obstacles in a specific order. What makes dog agility unique is that pet owners and their dogs can either participate for fun and exercise, or really commit to it and enroll in competition to test their skills against other teams.</p>
<p><a name="section2"></a>Best of all, it’s a great teamwork sport and a wonderful opportunity for you and your dog to bond and spend quality time together. Since your dog depends on you to tell them how to take each obstacle, you will develop trust, better communication, and a deeper bond. Your dog will enjoy the exercise and the feeling of having a job or purpose. It will also help to keep your dog’s body fit and their mind sharp.</p>
<h2>What Is Dog Agility?</h2>
<p>Dog agility is a timed event. The dog and handler with the fastest time on a course (without errors or penalties) are crowned the winner. A typical agility course will feature 12 &#8211; 18 obstacles. Obstacles can consist of tunnels, jumps, hurdles, weave poles, or ramps. The goal of the course is to force teams to encounter a variety of obstacles and test different forms of agility.<a name="section3"></a></p>
<p>Unlike dock diving or treibball, where the handler is largely stationary, the handler moves around quite a bit in agility competition, since they need to quickly lead their dog through the course in order to secure a competitive score.</p>
<h2>Who Can Participate in Dog Agility?</h2>
<p>Agility can be practiced with any <a href="https://www.petplace.com/article/breed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breed of dog</a>, no matter the size. The obstacles on a course are adjusted to fit the size of the dog. A dog and handler only need to be healthy enough to run through the course. <a name="section4"></a>If you’re interested in getting into dog agility, a good way to start is to <a href="http://natldogagilityleague.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">contact your local agility club</a> or an experienced coach, who can help you start your new hobby safely. Also, the age of the dog does not bar them from participating in agility. This game can be enjoyed by <a href="https://www.petplace.com/article/category/pet-care/dog-care/puppy-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puppies</a> and older dogs alike!</p>
<h2>How to Practice Agility Training with Your Dog</h2>
<p>To get started, begin basic skills training. You can purchase agility equipment online or start by working with homemade obstacles, like using a hula hoop for a tire jump or a large open box for a tunnel. You can also create weave poles by sticking PVC pipes into the ground, use a broomstick balanced on books as a low jump, or throw a blanket over two chairs to create a tunnel.</p>
<p>There are plenty of books and videos on dog agility training that can walk you through the process or you can learn the basics by joining a local agility class.</p>
<p>Your dog will be working off-leash, which means that they are free to run wherever they choose. You can’t touch your dog during agility training, but you can use cues and body language to direct them to where they need to go. Clear communication is key in dog agility. Your dog should be focused and keep their eyes on you as much as possible.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if your dog doesn’t catch on quickly. Some dogs are ready to move past the basics in just a few weeks, while other pups need more time and patience. Just remember to use a lot of praise and encouragement. Start by keeping your early home training sessions nice and short – they shouldn’t be any longer than five or ten minutes. The goal is to keep it fun and to stop before your dog loses interest.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief overview of training exercises for common obstacles:</p>
<h3>Jumps</h3>
<p>When practicing jumps, you should lower the bar so it is only a few inches off the ground. Before going for a jump, let your dog explore the equipment. Let them walk near it and take some sniffs to feel more comfortable with an unfamiliar object. When your dog becomes familiar, take them over the bar on a short lead and praise them when they clear it. Repeat this process slowly, raising the bar over time, but never to a height where they can knock the bar. With enough practice, they’ll get to the point where they can clear it on their own.</p>
<h3>Chutes and Tunnels</h3>
<p>Despite being two separate obstacles on a dog agility course, you can train for chutes and tunnels in the same way. First, fold the chute so that it is shorter in length, making it an easier challenge for your dog. Place a long lead on your dog’s leash that feeds through the chute and get them to sit at one end. Head to the other side and verbally encourage your pup to come through. If they don’t, try using their leash as a gentle guide. As they learn to travel through the chute or tunnel, make sure to shower them in praise. As they get more comfortable going through on their own, extend the chute or tunnel slowly until you finally hit the full length.</p>
<h3>Weave Poles</h3>
<p>Weave poles are common obstacles in agility, but they take a bit of work from a training perspective. A good way to start is by leashing your dog and walking them through the poles slowly. After a few rounds, ditch the leash and try deploying voice commands to guide them through the poles. As with the other steps, celebrating their progress is a great way to condition them to get through the poles on their own.</p>

</ol>
<p>The dog days of summer can be rough on dogs. Our four-legged friends are just as susceptible to dehydration and heat exhaustion as we are. Even worse, they can’t do much about it on their own. It’s up to vigilant dog lovers to take the necessary precautions, <a name="section2"></a>recognize the warning signs, and, if necessary, intervene to prevent deadly consequences.</p>
<p>Nutrition isn’t just about food. Like the human body, the canine body can’t function effectively unless it’s hydrated. Water accounts for nearly 80% of the body and it’s essential to practically 100% of bodily processes. It keeps the digestive system flowing, regulates your dog’s body temperature, helps promote urinary tract health, and much more.</p>
<h2>What Is Canine Dehydration?</h2>
<p>All healthy dogs (or mammals of any sort) circulate water throughout the day. Urinating, sweating, and even breathing cause your dog to steadily lose water, which they replenish as necessary by eating and drinking. When this intake and outtake is out of balance, a dog may become dangerously dehydrated.<a name="section3"></a></p>
<p>Untreated, dehydration has dire ripple effects throughout the body. Disrupted blood flow causes problems for every organ and the body loses its ability to deliver electrolytes. Without these, muscles and nerves falter and cells lack for necessary nutrients. A similar thing happens when we become dehydrated &#8212; hence the wide variety of replenishing, electrolyte-rich sports drinks.</p>
<h2>Causes of Dehydration in Dogs</h2>
<p>July is National Pet Hydration Month for a reason &#8212; hot weather presents increased dehydration risks for people and pets alike. Sweating and excessive panting lead dogs to lose fluids more quickly than usual and heat stroke can make matters even worse. As a dog gets hotter and hotter, its panting and heart rate both quicken and cause it to lose more water. Brachycephalic breeds, like <a href="https://www.petplace.com/article/dogs/breeds/dog-breeds/breathing-problems-in-french-bulldogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French Bulldogs</a>, and dogs with preexisting conditions are especially vulnerable, but any dog can fall prey.</p>
<p>That’s not to suggest that dehydration is a concern during the summer months alone. Limited fluid intake can impact a dog’s health any time of year. A dog might get dangerously dehydrated from something as simple as lack of access to water.<a name="section4"></a></p>
<p>Illnesses that lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and other fluid loss can cause and rapidly exacerbate dehydration in dogs. Quick action is essential when these symptoms are especially severe, as they can transform a temporary illness into a canine health emergency.</p>
<h2>Signs of Dehydration in Dogs</h2>
<p>Dogs look cute with their tongues hanging out of their mouths, but when is hot weather behavior a cause for concern? <a name="section5"></a>In addition to excessive panting, watch out for these <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/warning-signs-dehydration-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">warning signs</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dry eyes, nose, and gums</li>
<li>Loss of appetite, energy, and skin elasticity</li>
<li>Thick saliva</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing for Dehydration in Dogs</h2>
<p>The American Kennel Club (AKC) notes that pet owners can test for dehydration by assessing their dog’s skin elasticity. According to the organization’s chief veterinary officer, Dr. Jerry Klein, <a name="section6"></a>pet parents should gently pinch the skin near their dog’s shoulder blade, pull it, let go, and watch as it returns to its original position. A hydrated dog’s skin will snap back into place, while a dehydrated dog’s slowly recedes.</p>
<p>Dr. Klein encourages dog owners to test their dog’s skin elasticity under normal conditions. This will help them make an informed assessment if they need to test it for dehydration in the future. Owners of wrinkly breeds, Klein writes, should take special care to make these observations “because their [dogs’] skin may not be as elastic, even under normal conditions.”</p>
<h2>Treating Dehydration in Dogs</h2>
<p>Dehydration can go from bad to worse quickly. When dogs are dehydrated, they may lose their appetite and avoid taking in fluids from foods. In especially dire situations, severe diarrhea and vomiting can make dehydration worse too.<a name="section7"></a></p>
<p>Pet owners who suspect mild dehydration should immediately provide their dog with clean water and encourage them to drink. Persistent and severe symptoms could be a sign of electrolyte loss or heat stroke. In these instances, they should contact a veterinarian immediately. A vet may administer fluids through an IV or take other methods to alleviate their symptoms and replenish them quickly.</p>
<h2>How Much Water Does Your Dog Need?</h2>
<p>As with most health conditions, the best treatment for dehydration is avoiding it altogether. Providing your dog with a consistent supply of clean water and promoting a nutritious lifestyle can avoid the stress and cost of dehydration treatments.</p>
<p>Experts suggest that dogs need an ounce of water for each pound they weigh. Remember, however, that this is just a rule of thumb. High activity, hot weather, and other circumstances could necessitate much more fluid intake throughout the day.</p>
<p>If you suspect that dehydration may be a sign of another underlying health issue, consult with your veterinarian to develop an appropriate course of treatment.</p>

<li>Intermediate disease where puppies start to show clinical signs after weaning, which were initially mild, but progressive. Clinical signs usually present by 4 &#8211; 6 months.</li>
<li>Chronic (delayed) disease where dogs show very mild clinical signs, but have a normal life span. Clinical signs are usually seen under 1 year of age.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clinical signs can vary based on severity of disease and which clinical syndrome is present. The most severe clinical signs are marked weakness, inability to stand/ambulate, trouble eating or breathing due to muscle weakness, and incontinence. Less severe clinical signs include trouble walking (resulting in crawling or instability in the hindlimbs) and temperature regulation impairments (due to inability to pant). Hindlimbs are more affected than forelimbs, or clinical signs start in the hindlimbs and move forward.</p>
<h2>Diagnosis and Predisposed Breeds</h2>
<p>Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and classic affected breed predilection. Confirmatory diagnosis can be completed through nerve/muscle biopsies.</p>
<p>There are no documented treatment options for HCSMA in dogs. Most puppies are euthanized due to inability to walk or develop complications secondary to inability to eat and breath normally.</p>
<p>Breed predilections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brittany Spaniels were the initial subjects for the study and identification of HCSMA.</li>
<li>In the Rottweiler breed, <a href="https://www.vin.com/apputil/content/defaultadv1.aspx?pId=11157&amp;catId=29683&amp;id=3857014" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">early or accelerated syndrome has been noted in young puppies and is rapidly progressive</a>.</li>
<li>Swedish Lapland puppies are usually affected at &lt;8 weeks of age.</li>
<li>Stockard&#8217;s paralysis has been noted in St. Bernards bred with Great Danes or Bloodhounds. Clinical signs are normally seen between 11 &#8211; 14 weeks of age, ultimately resulting in <a href="https://www.vin.com/apputil/content/defaultadv1.aspx?pId=11157&amp;catId=29683&amp;id=3857014" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">severe degeneration of neurons in the lumbar spine</a>.</li>
<li>English Pointers may develop intermediate syndrome as they age.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.merckvetmanual.com/nervous-system/congenital-and-inherited-anomalies-of-the-nervous-system/congenital-and-inherited-spinal-cord-disorders?query=spinal%20muscle%20atrophy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">German Shepherds</a> have been noted to develop a focal form of spinal muscular atrophy, mainly affecting one or both thoracic limbs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Cats</h2>
<p>A similar disease process has been noted in cats, mainly in the Maine Coon breed. Kittens usually develop signs by 3 &#8211; 4 months of age, predominantly noted in the hind limbs, but <a href="https://vgl.ucdavis.edu/test/maine-coon-sma#:~:text=Spinal%20Muscular%20Atrophy%20(SMA)%20is%20a%20genetic%20disease%20seen%20in,muscles%20in%20the%20hind%20limbs." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">less progressive than in dogs</a>. The Veterinary Genetic Laboratory at UC Davis has developed a genetic test to isolate individuals that should not be used for breeding or that may develop clinical signs.</p>

<p><em>Is surgery for treating an elongated palate dangerous and how well do dogs recover after surgery?</em></p>
<p>Julie Bistram</p>
<h2>Dr. Debra&#8217;s Answer:</h2>
<p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>Thanks for your question about risks and recovery associated with canine elongated soft palate surgery.</p>
<p>As you may know, an elongated soft palate is a common congenital problem in brachycephalic dog and cat breeds, and is commonly part of brachycephalic airway syndrome. Brachycephalic breeds have broad, short skulls with adorable squished-in faces that result in physical problems like stenotic nares, extended nasopharyngeal turbinates, laryngeal collapse, hypoplastic trachea, everted laryngeal saccules, and/or an elongated soft palate. All of these abnormalities are considered a normal part of brachycephalic breeds, causing mild to severe respiratory tract symptoms. Brachycephalic breeds include the <a href="https://www.petplace.com/article/dogs/breeds/dog-breeds/breathing-problems-in-french-bulldogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French Bulldog</a>, Boston Terrier, Chinese Pug, Shih Tzu, and Pekingese.</p>
<p>The palate is the roof of the mouth, made up of both a hard and soft palate. The hard palate is the bony part of the mouth’s roof and the soft palate is the muscular part located at the back of the mouth. When the soft palate is too long, it is referred to as “elongated.”</p>
<h3>Symptoms of Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome</h3>
<p>Excess length essentially blocks the back of the throat, causing loud and/or labored breathing with additional symptoms like snoring, stridor, wheezing, reverse sneezing, trouble swallowing, and gagging. When the soft palate is long, symptoms can be substantial, putting dogs at higher risk for heat stroke.</p>
<p>When symptoms interfere with airway flow, surgery is the treatment of choice. Surgery for an elongated soft palate involves cutting the soft palate to a normal length so it doesn’t impinge the airway. The excess tissue is removed using a scalpel and scissors and closed with a suture. Laser surgery reduces hemorrhage and eliminates the need for sutures.</p>
<p>In general, many of the brachycephalic abnormalities are best corrected before secondary abnormalities develop (by two years of age). Swelling is a post-op concern, since it can interfere with breathing. Careful monitoring, drugs to control swelling, oxygen, and possible intubation may be required until swelling improves. Many dogs with multiple brachycephalic-related defects often need surgery to correct more than one problem. Although there are possible postoperative complications, surgery can improve quality of life considerably. Surgery should “cure” the underlying defect.</p>
<p>Other ways to help brachycephalic pets include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping them at a healthy weight</li>
<li>Using a harness, instead of a neck collar, to minimize pressure on the airway</li>
<li>Minimizing exposure to heat and humidity</li>
<li>Minimizing stress as much as possible</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please note: Dr. Debra’s guidance should not be considered veterinary advice like that provided by your veterinarian, since she is unable to personally examine your pet. If you have an immediate concern or emergency, contact a veterinarian or local veterinary hospital about your specific situation.</em></p>

First of all- we would like to sincerely thank you for your loyalty and support during these unprecedented times. We are doing everything we can to keep Relax Grill a safe, clean, and relaxing place to enjoy delicious food and refreshing drinks. We are constantly brainstorming ways to make sure we are doing what’s best for our patrons, employees, and our community as a whole <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f49a.png" alt="💚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Our hours of operation will temporarily be slightly different and will most likely last throughout the rest of Summer. Starting tomorrow, June 22nd, our hours will be as follows: Monday-Wednesday 4pm-9:30pm Thursday 11:30am-10pm Friday-Saturday 11:30am-10:30pm Sunday 11:30am-9pm Thank you so much for your patience and understanding. See you soon! We also understand that these are scary and confusing times for everyone. As a business, we have to take all variables into account when implementing protocols, keeping up with statistics, and retaining any new information that can help us keep our staff and community safe. Taking into account that we are a 100% outdoor establishment and the Florida heat- we are not requiring our front of house staff to keep masks on all throughout the day. Rest assured- our (enclosed) kitchen staff has their masks on! We are sanitizing, cleaning, etc. as often as we are serving food and slinging drinks. Wishing everyone nothing but good health and we hope to see you soon! #relax #grill #lakeeola #downtown #orlando #summer #hours #lakeside #orlandofoodie #outsidebar #tikibar #swanboats</a></p>

If you plan on taking your pup to the beach, we have some safety tips and tricks to make sure your pets avoid a trip to the vet First, if you wouldn’t swim in the water that means they shouldn’t either. Ride tide and other deadly bacteria increases in warm water during the summer time. Avoid shallow bays and areas where water can remain idle and stagnant and make sure they don’t drink sea water or idle lake water Avoid going to the beach during the hottest part of the day. If the sand is too hot for you, it&#8217;s definitely too hot for your pet. It&#8217;s easy to burn the bottoms of their paws, so always check the sand and wear protection to avoid injury. Make sure to offer them plenty of fresh water and shade When you&#8217;ve had your fun for the day, make sure to give your pet a good rinse to get all salt, sand, and microorganisms off their coat. Dry their ears to avoid any ear infections. And, as always, make sure they are staying hydrated with lots of water! Being educated and mindful of the risks your pet can encounter will help reduce the chances of anything happening. Stay safe out there! #staysalty</a></p>

</ol>
<p>You can’t help but spot them while browsing at the pet store: row after row of crates, all big enough to fit a dog. They&#8217;re made of fiberglass or plastic or plain, old, open wire. Despite their many differences, they all evoke the same frightening image: Doggy Prison.</p>
<p>Despite their ominous appearance, crates can be a boon for a <a href="https://www.petplace.com/puppies.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puppy</a> – a home-away-from-home or a comfortable retreat when the family gets to be too much. Crate training can also help calm your dog’s anxiety. A wild dog’s den is their home where they can rest, sleep, and hide from danger. As natural den animals, dogs actually enjoy small, enclosed spaces. A crate will make your dog feel more secure, since it essentially becomes their den.</p>
<p><a name="section2"></a>Crate training is also a good way to teach your dog responsibility. Crates are great tools for housetraining, because dogs don&#8217;t like to soil their immediate environment. In addition, for car travel, being inside a crate is probably the safest place for a puppy to ride, and, for pups that have to fly cargo, crates provide a touch of the familiar on a plane.</p>
<p>When crate training your puppy, patience will be your best resource, since the entire procedure can take about six months or so to complete. It’s important to remember two things when crate training your dog – the crate should always be associated with pleasant experiences, and training should be a slow, step-by-step process.</p>
<h2>Hazards to Avoid When Crate Training Your Dog</h2>
<p>When used as punishment, a crate can make a dog feel frustrated and trapped. If you make a habit of doing this, your dog will become fearful and refuse to enter the crate.</p>
<p>You should never leave your dog in the crate for extended periods. <a name="section3"></a>Dogs who are crated all the time can become anxious or depressed. Puppies under six months of age should not be confined to the crate for more than four hours, because of their inability to control their bladders.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, only crate your dog during a training period. After that, it should be a place that they want to go voluntarily.</p>
<h2>Making Pups Comfortable with Their Crate</h2>
<p>First, make sure you don&#8217;t isolate your pup when they’re in the crate. Buy two crates, and put one in your bedroom – so your puppy can sleep beside you at night – and put the other in a busier part of the house for daytime use. Make the crate comfortable for your dog. Line the crate with a soft blanket, put in some small treats, and then show the puppy how to get in.</p>
<p>Bring your puppy to the crate and use a happy voice to introduce it. Open and secure the door to ensure it won’t accidentally startle your dog by slamming shut or hitting them on the way in. Entice your dog with a trail of treats leading into the crate.</p>
<p>Once your puppy has figured out how to go in and out of the crate, and has satisfied their curiosity about it, use a cue word – such as &#8220;kennel&#8221; – as your puppy moves toward the crate, and hand them a treat as soon as they enter the enclosure. Repeat this several times at random intervals until your pup goes in when they’re told to do so. At this point, you can shut the door for short periods without making a big fuss about it. In fact, it&#8217;s best to ignore your pup while opening or shutting the door.</p>
<p>Once your puppy is willing to rest in the crate, start confining them for varying periods of time, and at different times of the day, like when you&#8217;re at home. The more random and persistent you are, the less the dog will worry when you do have to leave the house. <a name="section4"></a>With this kind of routine, your puppy will learn to rest while crated, and that&#8217;s exactly the way you want them to feel – at home, relaxed, and comfortable in their own little den.</p>
<p>Crate training teaches your dog that good things happen in the crate and that it’s a very nice place to relax. When they’re properly trained, dogs love their crates and happily spend time there whenever necessary.</p>
<h2>Feeding Your Dog in the Crate</h2>
<p>Once you have familiarized your dog with the crate, try feeding your dog’s meals nearby. This will help your dog associate pleasure with their crate. If your dog is still reluctant to enter, place your bowl partially inside the enclosure. Then, each time you feed your dog, move the dish farther back into the crate.</p>
<p>When your dog is fully inside, close the door and let them finish their meal. Open the door to the crate as soon as your dog finishes eating. Then, each time you feed your dog in the crate, try leaving the door closed a few minutes longer. <a name="section5"></a>Your goal should be to leave your dog in the crate for 10 minutes after eating.</p>
<p>You’ll know that you have increased the length of time in the crate too quickly if your dog whines to get out. Make sure not to let them out of the crate until they stop whining. Otherwise, they’ll learn that you will reward their whining by taking them out of the crate, and they’ll continue behaving in this fashion.</p>
<h2>Learning to Love Lockup</h2>
<p>On occasion, you may want your pup to remain in the crate when they want to get out. Don&#8217;t try to fool your puppy by calling them to you and then forcing them into the crate. Instead, use a command like: &#8220;Go to your crate,&#8221; and lure them in with a little food. Hand over the treat as soon as they settle down inside the crate, and praise them and keep feeding them while they’re inside. The minute your pup ventures out, turn off the food supply – and the charm.</p>
<p>Put a few pieces of kibble in the crate so your pup will develop the habit of going into the crate on their own, earning more praise and even more treats. Sooner or later, they&#8217;ll learn that they get lots of attention, affection, and goodies inside the crate – and very little in the way of treats outside of the crate.</p>
<p>Once your dog starts going into the crate on a regular basis, reward them by giving a long-lasting, treat-dispensing chew toy. Doing so will encourage your dog to relax and settle in for longer periods of time.</p>
<p><a name="section6"></a>By the way, never put your pup in the crate for misbehavior &#8220;time-outs&#8221; or punishment. Using a crate in this way will render it aversive and less useful as a behavior management tool.</p>
<p>If your crated dog begins to whine, you must determine if they are whining because they don’t want to be in the crate or if they’re whining because they have to go outside to eliminate. You should never reward your dog for whining by letting them out of the crate. Ignore your dog for several minutes to see if the whining stops. If that doesn’t work, try prompting your dog with the phrase you use to get them outside. If your dog reacts with excitement, it’s best to get them outside as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2>Housetraining and the Crate</h2>
<p>To confine an untrained dog for long periods is to court disaster. If the pup is forced to soil in their crate, the crate will no longer inhibit their elimination and will be of no help when you wish to employ it for house training.</p>
<p>Basically, house-training a dog is solving a spatial problem. You want to teach the dog to eliminate only in one place – outdoors. During the training period, it&#8217;s up to you to set limits. For example, if you don&#8217;t allow your pup free access to the living room and bedrooms, they can&#8217;t make a mess on the carpets there.</p>
<p>Because most puppies can&#8217;t control their urine and feces for extended periods of time, the most important part of any house-training program is setting up and sticking with a schedule that your puppy can maintain. Feed your dog at consistent times during the day and watch your pup’s natural schedule. Puppies usually need to eliminate shortly after waking up, after eating, and after playing. Young puppies may need to urinate every four hours.</p>
<p>When your pup eliminates in a designated area, praise and reward them immediately with play or a treat. People usually reward their pup for urinating outside only after they have brought them back indoors. This is a mistake, because it rewards the pup for coming inside, not for eliminating outside. Instead, keep a few treats in your pocket and hand them out on the spot.</p>
<p>If your pup repeatedly messes inside the crate, take the puppy to your vet to rule out medical problems, such as intestinal parasites and urinary-tract diseases.</p>
<p>If you need to be away from home for a few hours, hire a dog walker to take the puppy out, or enclose your pup in a large pen to provide them with an opportunity to eliminate away from their resting spot. Leave newspaper or training pads down in one area when you are gone – but pick them up once you&#8217;re back home.</p>
<p>Punishment after the fact doesn&#8217;t work. If an &#8220;accident&#8221; happens, clean it up with a good enzymatic cleaner and blame yourself. <a name="section7"></a>You&#8217;re the one who wasn&#8217;t supervising the pup at the time the &#8220;accident&#8221; occurred. If you catch your dog in the act of eliminating indoors, make a loud noise to distract them, and then take them outside right away.</p>
<p>Dogs with separation anxiety will often urinate, defecate, or bark when confined. In fact, some dogs become so anxious when confined that they destroy their crates and hurt themselves in the process. These dogs may do better when confined in a larger area, but if the problem still persists, see your vet or check with a veterinary behaviorist.</p>
<h2>Crating a Dog Before Leaving the House</h2>
<p>Before you can leave your crated dog home alone, you must first make sure that they are comfortable in the crate. Your dog should be able to stay in the crate for about 30 minutes without becoming anxious before you try leaving them home alone. Start by leaving your dog in the crate for short periods while you leave. Use your command (such as “go to your crate”) and give your dog a treat. Praise them for going into the crate. Also, try leaving a chew toy to help occupy your dog’s time while you’re gone.</p>
<p>Put your dog into the crate about 5 to 15 minutes before you leave. When you leave the house, don’t make a big deal out of it, simply leave quietly. When you return home, it may be tempting to return your dog’s enthusiasm as well. Do not respond with excitement or enthusiasm when you see your dog. <a name="section8"></a>Instead, make the moment very calm and matter of fact.</p>
<p>As your dog continues to increase the amount of time they can comfortably stay in the crate, you can increase the amount of time that you leave your dog crated while you leave the house.<br />
It’s best to occasionally crate dogs while you’re at home. This will ensure that they do not associate the crate exclusively with loneliness and encourage them to associate it with positive emotions.</p>
<h2>Picking a Crate for Your Dog</h2>
<p>Crates come in different styles and sizes. Prices range from about $75 to $175. Make sure that you select a crate that is an appropriate size for your dog. A comfortable crate should be about twice the size of your pup and should be large enough for your dog to stand up and turn around while inside.</p>
<p>If you’re bringing home a puppy, make sure to purchase a crate that’ll fit your dog once they’re fully grown. Just make sure to block off the excess crate space so that your dog cannot eliminate at one end of the crate and move to the other end.</p>
<p>The most common types are the pressed fiberglass models favored by airlines (these are often called airline kennels), and the open-wire cages that are available at most pet stores. Fiberglass kennels are the sturdiest and safest for traveling in a car or airplane.</p>

<p>Purebred dogs get to take home the blue ribbon, but mutts have a special place in dog lovers’ hearts. According to the American Pet Products Association, <a href="https://www.animalsheltering.org/page/pets-by-the-numbers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">more than half of the nation’s pet dogs</a> are mixed-breed. <a name="section2"></a>Their numbers are on rise, too. All over the country, shelters (where mutts greatly outnumber purebred dogs) reported a <a href="http://wired.com/story/coronavirus-pet-adoption-boom/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">surge in adoptions</a> throughout the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stay-at-home orders have been tough on people everywhere, but they’ve meant a new home for millions of mixed-breed dogs.</p>
<h2>What Kind of Dog Is Your Mutt?</h2>
<p>Mutts offer just as much affection and companionship as purebreds. What they don’t offer is certainty. Many pet parents are left scratching their heads whenever someone asks, “What kind of dog is that?” This uncertainty can even make it challenging to develop healthcare regimes and effectively train a dog. After all, it’s one thing to guess a dog’s breed and quite another to go in with some guidelines.</p>
<p>While ambitious dog owners may be tempted to consult a breed guide to determine their pooch’s heritage, <a href="https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/features/dog-dna-testing#1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DNA testing services</a> make this assessment practically effortless. Ranging from around $60 for basic genetic screenings to more than $200 for comprehensive health assessments, most include a cheek swab for collecting DNA samples. Pet owners simply mail these to the manufacturer and wait to receive their findings.<a name="section3"></a></p>
<p>Nathan Sutter, a professor of medical genetics at Cornell University, notes that some services are better than others. Essentially, the value of your investment comes down to the size of an organization’s breed database. He also notes some pet owners will not be able to obtain especially accurate reports. “If a dog is mixed-breed and comes from a great many breeds,” he says, “then the breed test may be unable to identify most or all of the breeds contributing to the dog.”</p>
<h2>The Mutt Census</h2>
<p>Each year, the American Kennel Club (AKC) unveils its <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/dog-breeds/2020-popular-breeds-2019/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">registration statistics for purebred dogs</a>. These numbers provide for a ranking of the nation&#8217;s most popular breeds. In 2020, this list ranged from the most-popular Labrador Retriever to the 193rd-most-popular English Foxhound.</p>
<p>Statistics on mutt ownership are harder to come by. It wasn’t until 2011, when Mars Veterinary conducted the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/results-of-nations-first-ever-mutt-census-reveal-paw-print-of-nations-mixed-breed-population-119243304.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">first-ever Mutt Census</a>, that mixed-breed ownership data was published like AKC findings. After collecting DNA samples from more than 35,000 dogs and survey responses from an additional 16,000 pet owners, Mars shared the ten breeds most commonly found in the lineage of American mutts. They were as follows<a name="section4"></a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>German Shepherd</li>
<li>Labrador Retriever</li>
<li>Chow Chow</li>
<li>Boxer</li>
<li>Rottweiler</li>
<li>Poodle</li>
<li>American Staffordshire Terrier</li>
<li>Golden Retriever</li>
<li>Cocker Spaniel</li>
<li>Siberian Husky</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon publication, the company’s Veterinary Genetics Research Manager noted, “[Our] hope is that the pet community will use this information to provide better care for the nation’s mixed-breed dogs.”</p>
<h2>Celebrate National Mutt Day</h2>
<p>July 31st, 2020 is the fifteen-annual celebration of National Mutt Day. While 2020 hasn’t given most Americans much cause for celebration, it’s already been a banner year for dogs &#8212; especially mutts.</p>
<p>If you welcomed a mixed-breed dog into your home this year, consider celebrating with a new toy or by cooking up some <a href="https://www.petplace.com/article/dogs/pet-health/homemade-dog-treats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy, homemade treats</a>. No dog yet?

Too many treats can contribute to excess weight gain and consumption of an unbalanced diet. Pet owners should balance the amount of treats provided daily while still engaging with their pet.</p>
<h2>What Is the 10% Rule?</h2>
<p>90% of a pet’s caloric intake should come from a complete and balanced diet. 10% of a pet’s caloric intake can come from everything else, including treats, table foods, supplements, and foods used for medication administration.</p>
<p>A complete and balanced diet means that all the nutrients for your pet are present and in the correct proportions. When calories from food items that are NOT complete and balanced exceed more than 10%, it is likely your pet is not eating a balanced diet.<a name="section3"></a></p>
<h3>What Food Items Fall in the 10% Category?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Commercial pet treats</li>
<li>Diet toppers</li>
<li>Table scraps and other human foods</li>
<li>Toothpaste</li>
<li>Supplements</li>
<li>Food for medication administration</li>
<li>Marrow bones</li>
<li>Chews</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Do I Find Calorie Information on My Pet’s Treats?</h2>
<p>Calorie information is required on pet food labels. This will be labeled as kilocalories (kcals) per kilogram AND kilocalories per familiar unit (i.e. treat or piece). A kilocalorie is the same as 1 Calorie listed on a human food label. If you do NOT see calorie information listed on the pet food label of the product you are feeding or thinking of buying, find something else.<a name="section4"></a></p>
<p>Supplements (flavored chews, fish oil, etc.) do not usually list calories on their label, but they are often available through the manufacturer. Fish oil products typically contain 40 kcals per teaspoon. Some treats like bully sticks, hooves, pig ears, and other chews are exempt from including calorie content on the label. These do, however, contribute significant calories to your pet’s diet and can be difficult to factor into a diet plan when calories need to be adjusted.</p>
<h2>How Do I Figure Out Calorie Counts for Human Foods?</h2>
<p>Calorie information may be listed on the Nutrition Facts label. You can also find calorie information on the <a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">FoodData Central</a> database, which is provided by the USDA for foods that don’t typically come with a Nutrition Facts label, like fruits, vegetables, and certain protein sources.</p>
<p>Calorie counts for foods commonly given to pets include<a name="section5"></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peanut butter, smooth: 1 Tablespoon = 94 kcals</li>
<li>Canned pumpkin puree: 1 Tablespoon = 5 kcals</li>
<li>Boiled chicken breast, boneless, skinless: 1/2 cup = 106 kcals</li>
<li>Cheddar cheese: 1 cubic inch = 69 kcals</li>
<li>Baby carrots, raw: 1 large = 5 Calories</li>
<li>Green beans, boiled or steamed: 1/2 cup = 22 Calories</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Many Calories Should My Pet Consume on a Daily Basis?</h2>
<p>The World Small Animal Veterinary Association provides tables with the caloric needs for healthy adult <a href="https://wsava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Calorie-Needs-for-Healthy-Adult-Cats-updated-July-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cats</a> and <a href="https://wsava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Calorie-Needs-for-Healthy-Adult-Dogs-updated-July-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">dogs</a>. <a name="section6"></a>Your veterinarian can also help calculate your pet’s caloric needs, especially if they are over or underweight. These calculations are a good place to start, but may need to be adjusted over time based on your pet’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_-rwxqHYU&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">body condition score</a>.</p>
<p>For example, a 20lb ideal body weight dog needs to eat around 500 Calories (kcals) per day. This means 450 kcals should come from a complete and balanced diet, with no more than 50 kcals coming from anything else.</p>
<h2>What If My Pet Is Getting More than 10% of Their Calories from Treats?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure any commercial treats you are giving them include caloric content written as kcal/piece.<a name="section7"></a></li>
<li>Look for treats that contain fewer calories.</li>
<li>If you need to use treats for daily training or behavioral purposes, look for treats with ≤ 5 kcals per piece.</li>
<li>Consider making a daily treat bag or box, so that everyone in the household is treating from the same place without providing excess snacks.</li>
<li>If you are using high calorie bones or chews, consider reducing how often these are given as a special treat.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What If My Pet Keeps Begging for Treats?</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that begging is a learned behavior that is positively reinforced when given a high-value food.<a name="section8"></a> If you reward a negative behavior with a high-value food, this only reinforces their behavior. Our pets come to us as the providers of their food, so it is only natural for them to display begging behaviors towards their food source.</p>
<h2>What If I Want to Feed My Pet Homemade Human Foods?</h2>
<p>Most home-prepared recipes for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23683013" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">dogs</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31039096/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cats</a> found online or in books are NOT complete &amp; balanced. A <a href="https://acvn.org/directory/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">consultation</a> with a Board Certified Veterinary Nutritionist® is recommended for pet owners interested in preparing their pet’s food. This includes owners who would like to provide a combination of both commercial and home-prepared foods that exceed 10% of their pet’s daily intake. For example, an owner may wish to feed a commercial food in the morning, a complete &amp; balanced home-prepared meal at night, and then have 10% remaining to provide treats throughout the day.</p>
